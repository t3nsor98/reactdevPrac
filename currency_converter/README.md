## Vite + React

This project is built using **Vite**, which provides a minimal setup to get React working with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

---

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and `typescript-eslint` in your project.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Add Loading State**: Show a spinner or loading message while fetching exchange rates.
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error messages for API failures.
- **Dark Mode**: Add a toggle for light/dark themes.
- **Historical Data**: Allow users to view historical exchange rates.
